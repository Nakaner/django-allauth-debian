The tarball was rebuilt using the source tarball provided by pypi.debian.net,
and stripping from it all the allauth/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo files, using a
simple

`find allauth/locale/ -type f -name "*.mo" -delete`

These .mo files are binary files that are rebuilt during the build process. At
best their changes remain in the worktree, misleading the dpkg-source process.
